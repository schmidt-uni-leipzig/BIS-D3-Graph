## Note
This branch is unfinished. Tried to implement rectangle zoom.

## Problem
[Example](http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/3689931) uses axis to zoom.
Apparently this cannot be applied to the graph, because it does not have axis.
I tried to implement the rectangle zoom by translating and scaling to the selected area.
Translation works but scaling breaks my graph. Tried several approaches, none of it worked.
I added one of my unfinished solution, where one can toggle the rectangle zoom with the 'r' key and select the area.
The selected area is centered, but not scaled.
